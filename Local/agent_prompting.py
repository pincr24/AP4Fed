        "\n"
        "##Task: Your task is to activate or deactive one or a combination of architectural patterns for the next round of training. The objective is to optimize the system EVALUATION METRICS as much as possible.\n"
        "\n"
        "Ideally, we aim to optimize the following EVALUATION METRICS:\n"
        "1) Maximize Global Model Accuracy or F1 Score, which measures the overall predictive performance of the aggregated model across all clients.\n"
        "2) Minimize Total Round Time, defined as the elapsed time to complete a full federated learning round.\n"
        "3) Minimize Communication Time, representing the duration spent exchanging data between the server and clients during each round.\n"
        "4) Minimize Training Time, referring to the computational time each client requires to perform local model training.\n"
        "\n"
        "Here are the three ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS that you can consider to (de)activate:\n"
        "1) Client Selector: selects clients that will partecipate to the next round of Federated Learning. The selection is driven by the number of CPUs available by the clients. When active, you must specify 'selection_value': <int>, which is the CPU threshold. Only the clients with CPU > selection_value will be included for the next training round. Critical Note: the value it can take is between 0 and n−1, where n is the number of CPUs present in the client with the largest CPU; otherwise, the system crashes.\n"
        "2) Message Compressor: compresses messages exchanged between the clients and the server.\n"
        "3) Heterogeneous Data Handler: mitigates non-IID effects using class reweighting, augmentation, or distillation.\n"  
        "\n"
        "Architectural Patterns Performance Implications:\n" 
        "Enabling or disabling each architectural pattern has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance:\n"
        "- Client Selector (CS): Selects clients with highest number of CPUs to reduce slowdowns caused by clients devices (the Straggler effect). Discarding weaker clients reduces total round time and training time. However, you should keep excluding lower-capacity clients as long as this strategy yields improvements in Val F1 (accuracy); if Val F1 stagnates or decreases, reconsider and gradually re-include them to preserve model diversity. To be activated when there are differences between clients with different CPUs. \n"
        "- Message Compressor (MC): Compresses model updates exchanged between the server and clients to reduce communication time, which is especially beneficial for large models or bandwidth-constrained networks. The downside is the additional computational overhead from compression and decompression, which may outweigh the benefits when dealing with small model sizes. Enable MC when communication time is a clear bottleneck and apply it sparingly, avoiding consecutive rounds.\n"
        "- Heterogeneous Data Handler (HDH): Employs data augmentation to address and mitigate data heterogeneity among non-iid clients, improving global model accuracy and accelerating convergence on non-IID data. The trade-off is an increase in local computation required to generate synthetic data for balancing class distributions, which can add significant overhead. To be activated if non-IID clients are present; consider at most a later follow-up if new non-IID data arrives (New Data).\n"

        "- Do not invent values.\n"
        "- Output only the JSON object plus the rationale, no extra text otherwise the system will fail.\n"
        "- The last line of the 'rationale' must be exactly the signature: CS=<ON|OFF>; MC=<ON|OFF>; HDH=<ON|OFF>. These values must copy the JSON decisions above, in the same order and casing.\n"
        "- Considering the Client Selector, keep at least two clients active in every round: You MUST analyze the CPU values of all clients and choose an integer threshold that is strictly below the CPU values of at least two clients, so that at least two clients remain eligible and the system does not crash.\n"
        "- When 'client_selector' is 'ON', you MUST derive 'selection_value' from the observed CPU values of all clients. A threshold t is SAFE only if at least two clients satisfy CPU > t and at least one client satisfies CPU <= t. Examples: with CPUs {5,5,5,3,3}, safe thresholds are 3 or 4; with CPUs {3,3,3,2,1}, safe thresholds are 1 or 2. Do NOT invent arbitrary thresholds unrelated to the observed CPUs.\n"
        "- Before finalizing 'selection_value', mentally simulate how many clients have CPU > selection_value. If fewer than two clients would remain active, that value is INVALID and MUST NOT be used.\n"
        "- Prefer the SMALLEST safe 'selection_value' that excludes at least one lower-CPU client while keeping at least two clients with CPU > selection_value; if no such value exists, you MUST keep \"client_selector\":\"OFF\".\n"
        "- Do not keep architectural patterns permanently OFF. If a pattern (especially Message Compressor or Heterogeneous Data Handler) has been OFF in recent rounds and the evidence is weak or ambiguous, you should sometimes decide ON to probe its effect, instead of always defaulting to the safest minimal configuration.\n"
        "- In the absence of strong evidence, testing a pattern to verify its improvements is allowed. However, Activating a pattern always introduces overhead. Carefully consider whether it is really necessary. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS SHOULD NEVER BE ACTIVATED.\n"
        "- When some clients are non-IID or validation F1 is clearly worse than in comparable IID runs, you are expected to enable Heterogeneous Data Handler at least once early in the training to test its effect. If HDH has been rarely used and F1 remains poor while round times are acceptable, you should be willing to enable it again in later rounds to reassess its final impact.\n"
        "- If you aggregate metrics over multiple rounds (mean/median), explicitly say which statistic and window you used; otherwise state 'last-round only'.\n"
        "- If a pattern is already active from the previous round and you decide to keep it active, specify that 'it is kept active' and not, for example, 'we activate the pattern'.\n"
        "- Do not rely on unstated assumptions; prioritize the system's current configuration (e.g., number of clients with non-IID data, number of client's CPUs) over past evaluation metrics, which should be used only as secondary context.\n"
        "- When citing Training/Communication Time, always use client-level aggregates (mean and range min–max for the round).\n"
